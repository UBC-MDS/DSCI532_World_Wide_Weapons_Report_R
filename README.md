# Report on Global Weapon Trade and its Relationship with GDP

## About
This repository was created as part of an assignment in [UBC's Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) program. The goal of the assignment is to create an interactive dashboard that effectively visualizes specified research questions.

The interactive dashboard can be found here **(link to be added upon deployment)**

## Description 

The app has a single landing page that shows four plots that change based on a slider bar that changes the year shown, and two buttons. The two buttons specify import and export of weapons for each country globally (as available in the dataset).  All four graphs change according to the button selected. The first graph is a global choropleth of each country with the colour shaded to the scale generated by the button selected. The bar graph below shows countries in the given year that have the largest weapon import or export as a percentage of GDP. For both the global choropleth plot, and the percentage of GDP plot, the data plotted changes with a slider bar that changes the year. The time-series data for specified countries (by the dropdown at the top) is displayed on the bottom two graphs. The default of the bottom 2 charts will show USA data. This allows a comparison between global changes and the specified country.

Please see the [Proposal](proposal.md) to further understand the purpose, motivation, data and research questions behind the report.
